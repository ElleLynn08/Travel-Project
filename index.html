              The unanswered questions surrounding Machu Picchu's past and
              breathtaking views as you trek the Inca Trail to discover this
              marvel is why it is among the 7 Wonders of the Modern World.
              Today, Machu Picchu is one of South America's most important
              archaeological sites and Peru's most-visited tourist attraction.

            <h2>Why Machu Picchu?</h2>
            <h3>Machu Picchu, one of the 7 Wonders of the Modern World</h3>
            <p>
              Embedded within a dramatic landscape at the meeting point between
              the Peruvian Andes and the Amazon Basin, at 7,972 ft above sea
              level, the Historic Sanctuary of Machu Picchu is among some of the
              most prominent artistic, architectural and land use achievements
              anywhere and the most distinguished tangible legacy of the Inca
              civilization. Having no written documentation of Machu Picchu by
              the Incas, there are so many questions left unknown which only
              adds to the mystique and magnetism of Machu Picchu.
            </p>
            <p>
              Known for its stunning cultural and natural ethos, the UNESCO
              World Heritage Site covers an area of 32,592 hectares of
              mountains, peaks, and valleys that encircle its core, the
              incredible archaeological monument of La Ciudadela or the Citadel.
              Machu Picchu is a testament to the power and ingenuity of the
              Incan empire. An engineering masterpiece from 1450AD, Machu Picchu
              stands as a testament to the ability of the Incas, who crafted it
              without mortar, metal tools, or the wheel. After the Spanish
              conquistadors conquered the Incan Empire in the sixteenth century,
              the sanctuary was abandoned and never found by the Spanish. Long
              forgotten for hundreds of years, Machu Picchu was revealed to the
              world anew when archeologist Hiram Bingham rediscovered it in
              1911.

              Hi, I'm Míchelle! Having been living in La Paz, Bolivia with my
              husband and our two fur babies, we are avid travelers and
              adventure seekers, always ready to explore and trek the road less

              as it will be our next big adventure in South America as we plan
              our 26-mile hike along the Inca trail scaling 13,828 feet through
              the Andes.
