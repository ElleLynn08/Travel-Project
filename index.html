            <h3>Machu Picchu, one of the New 7 Wonders of the Modern World</h3>
            <p>
              Embedded within a dramatic landscape at the meeting point between
              the Peruvian Andes and the Amazon Basin, the Historic Sanctuary of
              Machu Picchu is among the greatest artistic, architectural and
              land use achievements anywhere and the most significant tangible
              legacy of the Inca civilization.
            </p>
            <p>
              Recgonized for outstanding cultural and natural values, the mixed
              World Heritage property covers 32,592 hectares of mountain slopes,
              peaks and valleys surrounding its heart, the spectacular
              archaeological monument of “La Ciudadela” (the Citadel) at more
              than 2,400 meters above sea level. Built in the fifteenth century
              Machu Picchu was abandoned when the Inca Empire was conquered by
              the Spaniards in the sixteenth century. It was not until 1911 that
              the archaeological complex was made known to the outside world.

            <p>
              Hi, I'm Míchelle! Having been living in La Paz, Bolivia with my
              husband and our two fur babies, we are avid travelers and
              adventure seekers, always ready to explore and trek the road less
              traveled. I created this page as part of a project for SheCodes
              Responsive to develop my coding skills. This page is significant
              as it will be our next big adventure in South America as we plan
              our 26-mile hike along the Inca trail scaling 13,828 feet through
              the Andes.
