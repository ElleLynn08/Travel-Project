              The unanswered questions surrounding Machu Picchu's past and
              breathtaking views as you trek the Inca Trail to discover this
              marvel is why it is among the 7 Wonders of the Modern World.
              Today, Machu Picchu is one of South America's most important
              archaeological sites and Peru's most-visited tourist attraction.

            <h2>Why Machu Picchu?</h2>
            <h3>Machu Picchu, one of the 7 Wonders of the Modern World</h3>
            <p>
              Embedded within a dramatic landscape at the meeting point between
              the Peruvian Andes and the Amazon Basin, at 7,972 ft above sea
              level, the Historic Sanctuary of Machu Picchu is among some of the
              most prominent artistic, architectural and land use achievements
              anywhere and the most distinguished tangible legacy of the Inca
              civilization. Having no written documentation of Machu Picchu by
              the Incas, there are so many questions left unknown which only
              adds to the mystique and magnetism of Machu Picchu.
            </p>
            <p>
              Known for its stunning cultural and natural ethos, the UNESCO
              World Heritage Site covers an area of 32,592 hectares of
              mountains, peaks, and valleys that encircle its core, the
              incredible archaeological monument of La Ciudadela or the Citadel.
              Machu Picchu is a testament to the power and ingenuity of the
              Incan empire. An engineering masterpiece from 1450AD, Machu Picchu
              stands as a testament to the ability of the Incas, who crafted it
              without mortar, metal tools, or the wheel. After the Spanish
              conquistadors conquered the Incan Empire in the sixteenth century,
              the sanctuary was abandoned and never found by the Spanish. Long
              forgotten for hundreds of years, Machu Picchu was revealed to the
              world anew when archeologist Hiram Bingham rediscovered it in
              1911.

                <h4>Cusco</h4>
                <p>
                  Once the capital of the Inca empire, Cusco (or Cuzco in the
                  English spelling) is nestled in the Andes Mountains at 11,152
                  ft. and is home to a legendary history that includes the rise
                  and fall of the Inca Empire followed by the invasion of
                  Spanish conquistadors in the early 1500s. Today, remnants of
                  both eras share the narrow city streets – from centuries-old
                  baroque cathedrals to exquisite stone masonry – creating a
                  rare collision of Andean and Spanish styles that makes Cusco
                  like no other place on earth.
                </p>
                <h5>Significance:</h5>
                <p>
                  As the oldest city in the Americas, Cusco has been inhabited
                  continuously for over 3,000 years shaping its culture,
                  history, and architecture.
                </p>
                <h5>What I find interesting:</h5>
                <p>
                  Cusco’s history makes it captivating in the present. With
                  remnants of over eight cultures, every aspect of the city of
                  Cusco is rich in history. With a blend of Inca and Spanish
                  architecture to the ruins that date to pre-Inca times, the
                  history of Cusco oozes appeal.

                <h4>Vinicunca</h4>
                <p>
                  Quickly becoming a noteworthy tourist attraction in the land
                  of the Incas, Vinicunca, a word originating from Peru’s native
                  tongue Quechua, which translates to “colored mountain” or
                  Mountain of Seven Colors, is located in the Peruvian Andes,
                  just three hours from Cusco. At 17,060 ft. above sea level,
                  until recently, Vinicunca was hidden beneath ice and snow when
                  climate change caused the glaciers to melt, revealing the
                  geological wonder and offering stunning views that will take
                  your breath away.
                </p>
                <h5>Significance:</h5>
                <p>
                  Vinicunca is a sacred location in Peruvian culture that
                  represents masculinity and fertility and protects the
                  surrounding villages from evil.
                </p>
                <h5>What I find interesting:</h5>
                <p>
                  This magnificent view is made possible by the mountain being
                  concentrated with 14 different colorful minerals and was not
                  visible as it was covered in snow yearly until 2013. The
                  extraordinary landscape of Vinicunca makes this an addition to
                  my bucket list, knowing the journey will be just as good as
                  the destination.

                  Unique and quaint, the town of Aguas Calientes is only
                  accessible via train and is the gateway to the trails to take
                  you to Machu Picchu. This distinct town has no vehicles other
                  than the buses and trains that take you to the Citadel. Named
                  after the thermal-medicinal waters that are approximal to the
                  city's center, you can relax surrounded by the beautiful
                  landscape of mountains after an arduous hike.

                  Surrounded by mountains, cliffs, rivers, and an imposing cloud

                  incredible Peruvian dining options, lodging, and artisanal
                  treasures. Aside from the major attraction of visiting Machu
                  Picchu, this metropolis has plenty of day hikes to The Mándor
                  waterfalls, surrounded by abundant vegetation and a great
